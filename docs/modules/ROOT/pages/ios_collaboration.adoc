The Mobile App for iOS supports the following collaboration functionality:

* Adding users and grant permissions
* Adding groups and grant permissions
* Changing permissions permissions
* Deleting collaborators

== Grant Access With Links

Just as with the web interface, the iOS app lets you grant access to both files and folders with links.
Specifically, you can do the following:

* xref:copy-public-links[Copy public links]
* xref:create-private-links[Create private links]
* xref:set-passwords-and-expiration-dates[Set passwords and expiration dates]
* xref:send-private-link-urls-to-other-apps[Send private link URLs to other apps (mail, messenger)]
* xref:delete-private-links[Delete private links]

=== Copy Public Links

To copy a public link to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links].
As in the example below, you will then see the private link to the file.
Clicking btn:[copy] on the far right-hand side will copy the link to the iOS clipboard.

=== Create Private Links

To create private links to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links].
Then, under Private Links, click btn:[Create Public Link] in the Public Links section.
You will then see the links for the option, as in the image below.

As with the web interface, you can set:

* A link name
* Link permissions
* xref:set-passwords-and-expiration-dates[A link password and expiration date]
