* Delete private links

=== Copy Public Links

To copy a public link to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links].
As in the example below, you will then see the private link to the file.
Clicking btn:[copy] on the far right-hand side will copy the link to the iOS clipboard.

=== Create Private Links

To create private links to a file or folder, click the more icon on the far right-hand side of the file, and then click btn:[Links].
Then, under Private Links, click btn:[Create Public Link] in the Public Links section.
You will then see the links for the option, as in the image below.

As with the web interface, you can:
