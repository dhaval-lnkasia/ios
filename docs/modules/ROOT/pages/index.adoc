= The Mobile App for iOS

Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and convenient.
You can use any web browser on any operating system without installing special client software.
However, the ownCloud iOS app offers several key advantages over the web interface; these include:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on an iPhone or iPad
* Upload files easily from your device to ownCloud
* An Optional PIN for stronger security
* Share files with other ownCloud users
//* Automatic synchronization of your files (soon)
