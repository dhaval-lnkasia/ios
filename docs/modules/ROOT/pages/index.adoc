== Introduction

Accessing your files on your ownCloud server via the Web interface is easy and convenient, as you can use any Web browser on any operating system without installing special client software. However, the ownCloud iOS app offers some advantages over the Web interface:

* A simplified interface that fits nicely on an iPhone or iPad
* Automatic synchronization of your files (soon)
* Share files with other ownCloud users
* Easily upload files from your device to ownCloud
* Optional PIN for stronger security
